This is a placeholder file. The actual gradle-wrapper.jar needs to be downloaded from:
https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip

Or you can run the following command to generate it automatically:
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.5

For Windows users, you can also use:
gradlew.bat wrapper --gradle-version 8.5

The actual gradle-wrapper.jar file should be approximately 62KB.
